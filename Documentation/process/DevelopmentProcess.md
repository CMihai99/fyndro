# Development Process Guide

The purpose of this document is to help developers work with the development community
with a minimum of frustration. It is an attempt to document how this community works in a way
which is accessible to those who are not intimately familiar with the Fyndro development.
While there is some technical material here, this is a process-oriented discussion
which does not require a deep knowledge of programming to understand.
