The purpose of this document is to help developers work with the development community
with a minimum of frustration. It is an attempt to document how this community works in a way
which is accessible to those who are not intimately familiar with Fyndro development
(or free software development in general). While there is some technical material here, this is a
process-oriented discussion which does not require a deep knowledge of programming to understand.
