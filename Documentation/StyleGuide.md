# Style guide

## General rules

- Write comprehensive and robust tests that cover the changes you've made in your work.
- Make sure all the existing tests pass.
- Document everything thoroughly.

## Code Rules

- Follow the appropriate code style standards for the language
  and framework you're using (e.g. Vue.js for JavaScript).
- Write readable code – keep functions small and modular and name variables descriptively.
- User-facing code should support the following browsers:
  - Microsoft Edge 14+
  - Chrome ``(Current - 1) and Current`` versions
  - Firefox ``(Current - 1) and Current`` versions
  - Opera ``(Current - 1) and Current`` versions

Note: ``(Current - 1)`` and Current means that we support the current stable version
of the browser and the version that precedes it.

## Documentation Rules

- Write readable documentation – keep descriptions small and explanations descriptively.
