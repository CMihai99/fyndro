# File settings:
#   text     These files should be normalized (i.e. convert CRLF to LF).
#   binary   These files are binary and should be left untouched.
#
# NOTE: binary is a macro for -text -diff.
#
# Auto detection:
#   Handle line endings automatically for files detected as text
#   and leave all files detected as binary untouched.
#   This will handle all files NOT defined below.
