## Bugs and Features

First, search for [existing and closed issues](https://github.com/CMihai99/fyndro/issues?q=is%3Aissue).
If your problem or idea is not addressed yet,
[open a new issue](https://github.com/CMihai99/fyndro/issues/new/choose).

Note, however, that feature implementations and bug fixes may take up to 7 days.

## Contribute

To be a truly great community, Fyndro needs to welcome developers from all walks of life,
with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly
community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code.
We will work diligently to make the community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, Fyndro has adopted a Code of Conduct

and you can also check up on our code of ethics [here](https://github.com/CMihai99/fyndro/blob/main/Documentation/process/CodeOfEthics.md).
