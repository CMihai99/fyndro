- **Bootstrap**. Andro is built on the Bootstrap 5 library and fully supports it.

- **Google Fonts**. By default, Andro is mostly built using the Arial font, however there are multiple other fonts used.

<a id="browser-support"><h2>Browser support</h2></a>

At the moment, we aim to support all major web browsers. Any issue in the browsers listed below should be reported as a bug:

- Chrome (Current - 1) and Current versions

(Current - 1) and Current means that we support the current stable version of the browser and the version that precedes it.
