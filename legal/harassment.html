        <p>
          Harassment includes bullying, intimidation, direct insults,
          malicious gossip and victimization. We can’t create an exhaustive list,
          but here are some instances that we consider harassment:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Sabotaging someone’s work on purpose.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Engaging in frequent or unwanted advances of any nature.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Commenting derogatorily on a person’s
              ethnic heritage or religious beliefs.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Starting or spreading rumors about a person’s personal life.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Ridiculing someone in front of others or singling them out
              to perform tasks unrelated to their job (e.g. bringing coffee) against their will.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sexual harassment is illegal and we will seriously investigate relevant reports.
          If a team-member is found guilty of sexual harassment, they will be terminated.

        <h3 id="addressing-harassment">How to address harassment</h3>
        <p>
          If you’re being harassed, whether by a team-member, maintainer
          or HR manager, you can choose to talk to any of these people:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Offenders.</strong>
              If you suspect that an offender doesn’t realize they are guilty of harassment,
              you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue.
              This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment
              (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues.)
              Avoid using this approach with users.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Project maintainers.</strong>
              Feel free to reach out to project maintainers in charge with HR
              in any case of harassment no matter how minor it may seem.
              For your safety, contact HR as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment (e.g. sexual advances).
              Anything you disclose will remain confidential.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="disciplinary-consequences">Disciplinary Consequences</h3>
        <p>
          Punishment for harassment depends on the severity of the offence
          and may include counseling, reprimands, suspensions or termination.
