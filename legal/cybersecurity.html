        <p>
          When maintainers and contributors use their digital devices to access company emails or accounts,
          they introduce security risk to our data.
          We advise our maintainers and contributors to keep both their personal and company-issued computer, tablet and cell phone secure.
          They can do this if they:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Keep all devices password protected</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Choose and upgrade a complete antivirus software</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Ensure they do not leave their devices exposed or unattended</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Install security updates of browsers and systems monthly or as soon as updates are available</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Log into company accounts and systems through secure and private networks only</strong></p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="keeping-emails-safe">Keeping emails safe</h3>
        <p>
          Emails often host scams and malicious software
          (e.g. <a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/knowledge/email-worm"
          target="_blank" class="links">worms</a>).
          To avoid virus infection or data theft, we instruct maintainers and contributors to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Avoid opening attachments and clicking on links when the content is not adequately explained
                (e.g. "watch this video, it’s amazing.")
              </strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Be suspicious of clickbait titles (e.g. offering prizes, advice.)
              </strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Check email and names of people they received a message from to ensure they are legitimate.
              </strong></p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="managing-passwords-properly">Managing passwords properly</h3>
        <p>
          Password leaks are dangerous since they can compromise our entire infrastructure.
          Not only should passwords be secure so they won’t be easily hacked,
          but they should also remain secret. For this reason, we advice our maintainers and contributors to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Choose passwords with at least eight characters
                (including capital and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols)
                and avoid information that can be easily guessed (e.g. birthdays)
              </strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Remember passwords instead of writing them down.
                If maintainers and contributors need to write their passwords,
                they are obliged to keep the paper or digital document confidential and destroy it when their work is done
              </strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Exchange credentials only when absolutely necessary.
                When exchanging them in-person isn’t possible,
                maintainers and contributors should prefer the phone instead of email,
                and only if they personally recognize the person they are talking to</strong>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Change their passwords every two months</strong></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Remembering a large number of passwords can be daunting.
          We will purchase the services of a password management tool which generates and stores passwords.
          maintainers and contributors are obliged to create a secure password for the tool itself,
          following the abovementioned advice.
        </p>

        <h3 id="transferring-data-securely">Transferring data securely</h3>
        <p>Transferring data introduces security risk. maintainer or contributors must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Avoid transferring sensitive data (e.g. customer information, maintainer or contributor records)
                to other devices or accounts unless absolutely necessary.
              </strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Share confidential data over the company network or system and not over public Wi-Fi or private connection
              </strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Ensure that the recipients of the data are properly authorized
                people or organizations and have adequate security policies
              </strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>
                Report scams, privacy breaches and hacking attempts
              </strong></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our team need to know about scams,
          breaches and malware so they can better protect our infrastructure.
          For this reason, we advise our maintainer or contributors to report perceived attacks,
          suspicious emails or phishing attempts as soon as possible to our specialists.
        <p>
        <p>
          Our team must investigate promptly,
          resolve the issue and send a companywide alert when necessary.
          Our Security Specialists are responsible for advising maintainer or contributors on how to detect scam emails.
          We encourage our maintainer or contributors to reach out to them with any questions or concerns.
