      <h3 id="definition">What is sexual harassment?</h3>
      <p>Sexual harassment has many forms of variable seriousness. A person sexually harasses someone when they:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Insinuate, propose or demand sexual favors of any kind.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Invade another person's personal space (e.g. inappropriate touching.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Stalk, intimidate, coerce or threaten another person to get them to engage in sexual acts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Send or display sexually explicit objects or messages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Comment on someone's looks, dress, sexuality or gender in a derogatory
            or objectifying manner or a manner that makes them uncomfortable.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Make obscene comments, jokes or gestures that humiliate or offend someone.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pursue or flirt with another person persistently without the
            other person's willing participation. Flirting with someone at an inappropriate time
            (e.g. in a team meeting) is considered sexual harassment,
            even when these advances would have been welcome in a different setting.
            This is because such actions can harm a person's professional reputation
            and expose them to further harassment.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The most extreme form of sexual harassment is sexual assault.
        This is a serious crime and our company will support maintainers or contributors
        who want to press charges against offenders.
      </p>

      <h3 id="our-rules">Fyndro's rules on sexual harassment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>No one has the right to sexually harass our maintainers or contributors.</strong>
            Any person in our company who is found guilty of serious harassment will be
            <a href="termination.html" id="links">terminated</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Sexual harassment is never too minor to be dealt with.</strong>
            Any kind of harassment can wear down maintainers or contributors and create a hostile workplace.
            We will hear every claim and punish offenders appropriately.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Sexual harassment is about how we make others feel.</strong>
            Many do not consider behaviors like flirting or sexual comments to be sexual harassment,
            thinking they are too innocent to be labeled that way.
            But, if something you do makes your colleagues uncomfortable, or makes them feel unsafe, you must stop.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>We assume every sexual harassment claim is legitimate unless proven otherwise.</strong>
            We listen to victims of sexual harassment and always conduct our investigations properly.
            Occasional false reports do not undermine this principle.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>We will not allow further victimization of harassed maintainers or contributors.</strong>
            We will fully support maintainers or contributors who were sexually harassed and will not take any adverse action against them.
            For example, we will not move them to positions with worse pay or benefits
            or allow others to retaliate against them.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Those who support or overlook sexual harassment are as much at fault as offenders.</strong>
            HR is especially obliged to prevent sexual harassment and act
            when they have suspicions or receive reports. Letting this behavior go on
            or encouraging it will bring about disciplinary action.
            Anyone who witnesses an incident of sexual harassment
            or has other kinds of proof should report to HR.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="how-to-report">How to report sexual harassment</h3>
      <p>
        If you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed),
        please report it to HR managers. In serious cases like sexual assault,
        please call the police and inform HR that you plan to press charges.
        We acknowledge it's often hard to come forward about these issues,
        but we need your help to build a fair and safe workplace for you and your colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to report sexual harassment within our company, there are two options:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Ask for an urgent meeting with an HR manager.</strong>
            Once in the meeting, explain the situation in as much detail as possible.
            If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Send your complaint via email.</strong>
            If you address it to your supervisor, please email an HR manager and attach any evidence
            or information that can be used in the investigation.
            HR and your supervisor will discuss the issue and contact you as soon as possible.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you report assault to the police, our company will provide
        any possible support until the matter is resolved.
        In any case, we will ensure you are not victimized and that you have access
        to relevant evidence admissible in court, like security video footage or emails
        (without revealing confidential information about other maintainers or contributors).
      </p>

      <h3 id="inadvertent-harassment">Inadvertent harassment</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes, people who harass others do not realize that their behavior is wrong.
        We understand this is possible, but that doesn't make the perpetrator
        any less responsible for their actions. If you suspect that someone doesn't realize
        their behavior is sexual harassment under the definition of this policy, 
        let them know and ask them to stop. Do so preferably via email so you can have records.
      </p>
      <p>Please do not use this approach when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Your manager, an upper manager, investor or customer is the perpetrator.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sexual harassment goes beyond the boundaries of off-hand comments, flirting or jokes.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the above cases, report to HR as soon as possible.</p>

      <h3 id="disciplinary-action">Disciplinary action and repeat offenders</h3>
      <p>
        Maintainers or contributors who are found guilty of sexual assault will be terminated
        after the first complaint and investigation.
      </p>
      <p>Maintainers or contributors who are found guilty of sexual harassment (but not assault) the first time may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Be reprimanded and fined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Get a "below expectations" performance review.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>See expected promotions and/or salary increases freeze for 1 year.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may also transfer harassers or take other appropriate action to protect their victims.
        We will terminate repeat offenders after the second claim against them
        if our investigation concludes they are indeed guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
        We apply these disciplinary actions uniformly. maintainers or contributors of any sexual orientation
        or other protected characteristics will be penalized the same way for the same offenses.
      </p>

      <h3 id="hr-responsibilities">HR responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        First and foremost, HR and managers should try to prevent sexual harassment
        by building a culture of respect and trust. But, when sexual harassment occurs
        and an employee makes a complaint, both HR and managers must act immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managers should talk to HR and explain our procedures to their team member who made the complaint.
        When HR receives a complaint that an employee harasses another employee, they will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Ask for as many details and information as possible from the person or people making the complaint.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Keep copies of the report with dates, times and details of incidents and any possible evidence
            in a confidential file (separate from the personnel file.) HR should update this file
            with all future actions and conversations regarding this complaint.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Launch an investigation. If the matter is complex, the HR person can defer to a more senior manager.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Check if there have been similar reports on the same person.
            If there are, HR should contact the perpetrator's manager
            to let them know that their team member may get fired when the investigation is over.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Inform the harassed maintainers or contributors of our company's procedures
            and their options to take legal action if appropriate.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Take into account the wishes of the harassed employee.
            Some might want the matter to be resolved informally and discreetly,
            while others might expect more radical actions (e.g. transferring the perpetrator).
            HR should consider the circumstances and decide on appropriate action.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Contact the harasser and set up a meeting to explain the complaint
            and explicitly ask for this behavior to stop, or,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Arrange for mediation sessions with the two maintainers or contributors
            (harasser and perpetrator) to resolve the issue, if the harassed employee agrees, <strong>or,</strong>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Arrange for mediation sessions with the two maintainers or contributors
            (harasser and perpetrator) to resolve the issue, if the harassed employee agrees, <strong>or,</strong>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Launch a disciplinary process depending on the severity of the harassment.
            In cases of sexual assault or coercing someone to sexual favors under threats,
            we will terminate the harasser immediately. We will terminate maintainers or contributors
            who are found guilty in a court of law of sexually assaulting another employee,
            even if HR has not conducted its own investigation.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>
          HR or managers must not, under any circumstances, blame the victim,
          conceal a report or discourage maintainers or contributors from reporting sexual harassment.
        </strong>
        If HR or a manager behaves that way, please send an email to their own manager
        or a senior HR leader explaining the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We welcome any feedback or complaints about our procedures
        and how our maintainers or contributors handled each case.
      </p>

      <h3 id="helping-harassment-victims">Helping harassment victims</h3>
      <p>
        Apart from investigating claims and punishing perpetrators, we want to support
        the victims of sexual harassment. If you experience trauma,
        stress or other symptoms because of harassment, consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Taking a few days of sick leave to restore your mental health.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Asking your insurance provider whether they cover mental health services.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Talking to our EAP (Employee Assistance Program) Officer to evaluate options.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Speaking to our designated counselors.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your job and benefits will not be jeopardized or altered
        if you choose any of those options or other means to recovery.
      </p>

      <h3 id="speak-up">Speak up, we listen</h3>
      <p>
        Sexual harassment can exhaust those who endure it. Speaking up about this issue
        is often tough for fear of not being heard, upsetting managers and challenging corporate culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don't let these fears deter you. Our company will do everything possible
        to stop sexual harassment and any other kind of harassment from happening,
        while supporting harassed employees. We need to know what's going on so we can act on it.
        And by raising your voice on this issue, you help our company create a happy workplace and thrive.
