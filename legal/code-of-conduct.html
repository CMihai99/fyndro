        <p>
          In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers
          pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free
          experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
          sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
          socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="standards">Our Standards</h3>
        <p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
          <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>

          <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>

          </li>
          <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior
          and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action
          in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
          comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
          or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors
          that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
        </p>

        <h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
        <p>
          This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies
          when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
          Examples of representing a project or community include
          using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,
          or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
          Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when there is a reasonable belief
          that an individual's behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.
        </p>

        <h3 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h3>
        <p>
          Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported
          by Contact Using the project team at androteamfaq@gmail.com.
          All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result
          in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
          The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
          Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith
